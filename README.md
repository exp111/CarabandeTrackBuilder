# Carabande Track Builder
Allows to build carabande tracks digitally.

## TODO
- allow multiple versions of one pack
- add other extensions (stunt pack, epsilon, half tiles)
- fix tile selection overlapping
- fix long tiles blocking all other tiles in the selection
- add 45Â° curves to the track generator
- fix curves sometimes causing a 1-2 pixel offset

## Known Issues
- Firefox's privacy.resistFingerprinting massively cripples Konva's drag performance. I exempted the domain to fix this.
